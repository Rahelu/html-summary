<h2>Summary</h2>
 <p>I am a German native speaker with fluent English skills. During my time working as a customer service representative and
as a recruitment consultant I have worked with clients and customers on a daily basis. Correspondence went via telephone
calls, e-mails and tickets to answer questions and to recruit clients. I strengthened my listening skills and patience
as a market researcher.</p>
